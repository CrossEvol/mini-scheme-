# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for implementing the frontend components of a MiniScheme compiler, including the lexer (tokenizer), parser, and Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) representation. The frontend will transform Scheme source code into a structured AST that can be used by subsequent compilation phases. The implementation will support core Scheme language features including special forms, data types, and built-in procedures as specified in the existing mini_scheme.md plan.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a compiler developer, I want a lexer that can tokenize Scheme source code, so that I can convert raw text into a structured sequence of tokens for parsing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the lexer encounters whitespace or comments starting with `;` THEN the system SHALL ignore them and continue tokenizing
2. WHEN the lexer encounters an identifier (letters, numbers, or special characters like `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `!`, `?`, `=`) THEN the system SHALL create an Identifier token
3. WHEN the lexer encounters a number (integer or floating-point) THEN the system SHALL create a Number token with the parsed value
4. WHEN the lexer encounters a string delimited by double quotes THEN the system SHALL create a String token with the content
5. WHEN the lexer encounters a character prefixed with `#\` THEN the system SHALL create a Character token
6. WHEN the lexer encounters `#t` or `#f` THEN the system SHALL create a Boolean token
7. WHEN the lexer encounters special syntax (`'`, `` ` ``, `,`, `,@`) THEN the system SHALL create appropriate punctuation tokens
8. WHEN the lexer encounters parentheses `(` or `)` THEN the system SHALL create LeftParen or RightParen tokens
9. WHEN the lexer reaches end of input THEN the system SHALL create an Eof token

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a compiler developer, I want the lexer to recognize Scheme keywords and special forms, so that the parser can handle them appropriately during syntax analysis.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the lexer encounters core keywords (`define`, `lambda`, `if`, `cond`, `let`, `let*`, `let-values`, `call-with-values`, `import`, `begin`, `set!`, `quote`, `quasiquote`, `unquote`, `unquote-splicing`) THEN the system SHALL create specific keyword tokens
2. WHEN the lexer encounters control flow keywords (`else`) THEN the system SHALL create appropriate keyword tokens
3. WHEN the lexer encounters built-in procedure names (`car`, `cdr`, `cons`, `list`, `vector`, predicates, type conversions) THEN the system SHALL create specific tokens for each procedure
4. WHEN the lexer encounters an identifier that matches a keyword THEN the system SHALL prioritize the keyword token over a generic identifier token

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a compiler developer, I want a parser that can build an Abstract Syntax Tree from tokens, so that I can represent Scheme programs in a structured format for further processing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the parser receives a sequence of tokens representing a literal value THEN the system SHALL create appropriate AST nodes (Number, String, Character, Boolean, Variable)
2. WHEN the parser encounters a function call pattern `(function arg1 arg2 ...)` THEN the system SHALL create a Call AST node with function and arguments
3. WHEN the parser encounters parentheses THEN the system SHALL parse the enclosed expression as a list or function call
4. WHEN the parser encounters unmatched parentheses THEN the system SHALL report a syntax error with location information
5. WHEN the parser completes successfully THEN the system SHALL return a valid AST representing the input program

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a compiler developer, I want the parser to handle Scheme special forms, so that I can correctly represent language constructs that don't follow normal evaluation rules.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the parser encounters `(define name value)` or `(define (name args...) body...)` THEN the system SHALL create a Define AST node
2. WHEN the parser encounters `(lambda (args...) body...)` THEN the system SHALL create a Lambda AST node with parameters and body
3. WHEN the parser encounters `(if condition then else)` THEN the system SHALL create an If AST node with condition, then-branch, and else-branch
4. WHEN the parser encounters `(cond (test body...) ... (else body...))` THEN the system SHALL create a Cond AST node with clauses
5. WHEN the parser encounters `(let ((var val) ...) body...)` THEN the system SHALL create a Let AST node with bindings and body
6. WHEN the parser encounters `(let* ((var val) ...) body...)` THEN the system SHALL create a LetStar AST node
7. WHEN the parser encounters `(let loop ((var val) ...) body...)` THEN the system SHALL create a LetLoop AST node
8. WHEN the parser encounters `(let-values (((var ...) expr) ...) body...)` THEN the system SHALL create a LetValues AST node
9. WHEN the parser encounters `(call-with-values producer consumer)` THEN the system SHALL create a CallWithValues AST node

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a compiler developer, I want the parser to handle quoted expressions and data structures, so that I can represent literal data and code-as-data constructs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the parser encounters `'expr` THEN the system SHALL create a Quote AST node containing the expression
2. WHEN the parser encounters `` `expr`` THEN the system SHALL create a QuasiQuote AST node
3. WHEN the parser encounters `,expr` THEN the system SHALL create an UnQuote AST node
4. WHEN the parser encounters `,@expr` THEN the system SHALL create an UnQuoteSplicing AST node
5. WHEN the parser encounters `(list item1 item2 ...)` or `'(item1 item2 ...)` THEN the system SHALL create a List AST node
6. WHEN the parser encounters `#(item1 item2 ...)` THEN the system SHALL create a Vector AST node
7. WHEN the parser encounters `(begin expr1 expr2 ...)` THEN the system SHALL create a Begin AST node with multiple expressions

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a compiler developer, I want comprehensive error handling and reporting, so that I can provide meaningful feedback when parsing fails.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the lexer or parser encounters invalid syntax THEN the system SHALL report an error with line and column information
2. WHEN the parser encounters unexpected tokens THEN the system SHALL report what was expected versus what was found
3. WHEN the parser encounters incomplete expressions THEN the system SHALL report missing components
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide enough context for developers to locate and fix the issue
5. IF the lexer encounters invalid character sequences THEN the system SHALL report the specific invalid sequence and location

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a compiler developer, I want a modular and extensible architecture, so that I can easily maintain and extend the frontend components.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the frontend THEN the system SHALL separate lexer, parser, and AST into distinct modules
2. WHEN adding new language features THEN the system SHALL allow extension without major refactoring
3. WHEN testing individual components THEN the system SHALL support unit testing of lexer and parser separately
4. WHEN integrating with the rest of the compiler THEN the system SHALL provide clean interfaces between components
5. IF new token types or AST nodes are needed THEN the system SHALL support adding them through enum extension

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a compiler developer, I want the implementation to handle the complete Scheme syntax as specified in the plan, so that all example files can be successfully parsed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system processes example Scheme files THEN the system SHALL successfully tokenize and parse all valid syntax
2. WHEN the system encounters all specified built-in procedures THEN the system SHALL recognize and tokenize them correctly
3. WHEN the system processes nested expressions THEN the system SHALL maintain correct structure in the AST
4. WHEN the system processes complex special forms THEN the system SHALL create appropriate AST representations
5. IF the system encounters syntax not covered in the specification THEN the system SHALL report it as unsupported rather than crashing
