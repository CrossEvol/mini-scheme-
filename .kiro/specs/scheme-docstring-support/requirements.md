# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for adding docstring support to the MiniScheme compiler. Docstrings are string literals that appear immediately after the parameter list in function definitions and serve as documentation for the function. While these strings are part of the function definition syntax, they should be recognized by the parser but skipped during compilation as they don't affect program execution. This feature will enhance code documentation capabilities while maintaining compatibility with standard Scheme syntax.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a Scheme developer, I want to include docstrings in my function definitions, so that I can document the purpose and behavior of my functions directly in the code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the parser encounters a string literal immediately after the parameter list in a define expression THEN the system SHALL recognize it as a docstring
2. WHEN the parser encounters `(define (function-name params...) "docstring" body...)` THEN the system SHALL parse the docstring as part of the function definition
3. WHEN the parser encounters multiple string literals after parameters THEN the system SHALL treat only the first string as a docstring
4. WHEN the parser encounters a docstring in a lambda expression `(lambda (params...) "docstring" body...)` THEN the system SHALL recognize and handle it appropriately
5. WHEN the parser encounters a function definition without a docstring THEN the system SHALL continue to work as before

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a MiniScheme compiler, I want to parse docstrings correctly without affecting the function's executable body, so that documented functions compile and execute properly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN compiling a function with a docstring THEN the compiler SHALL skip the docstring during code generation
2. WHEN compiling a function with a docstring THEN the compiler SHALL treat the expression after the docstring as the function body
3. WHEN compiling `(define (fn) "doc" expr)` THEN the compiler SHALL compile `expr` as the function body
4. WHEN compiling `(define (fn a b) "doc" (+ a b))` THEN the compiler SHALL compile `(+ a b)` as the function body
5. WHEN the function body contains multiple expressions after the docstring THEN the compiler SHALL treat them as an implicit begin block

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a MiniScheme parser, I want to distinguish between docstrings and regular string expressions in function bodies, so that I can correctly identify what constitutes documentation versus executable code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the parser encounters a string as the first expression after parameters THEN the system SHALL classify it as a docstring
2. WHEN the parser encounters a string not immediately after parameters THEN the system SHALL treat it as a regular string expression
3. WHEN the parser encounters `(define (fn) "doc" "another string")` THEN the system SHALL treat "doc" as docstring and "another string" as the function body
4. WHEN the parser encounters `(define (fn) (+ 1 2) "not a docstring")` THEN the system SHALL treat the string as part of the function body, not as documentation
5. WHEN validating function syntax THEN the system SHALL ensure docstrings appear in the correct position

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a MiniScheme developer, I want the AST to represent docstrings appropriately, so that future tooling can extract and use documentation information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating AST nodes for functions with docstrings THEN the system SHALL include the docstring in the DefineExpr or Lambda AST node
2. WHEN the AST contains a docstring THEN it SHALL be stored as an optional field that doesn't affect compilation
3. WHEN serializing or displaying AST nodes THEN the system SHALL include docstring information for debugging purposes
4. WHEN the function has no docstring THEN the docstring field SHALL be None/null
5. IF future tooling needs to extract docstrings THEN the AST SHALL provide access to the documentation strings

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a MiniScheme user, I want docstring support to be backward compatible, so that existing code without docstrings continues to work unchanged.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing existing code without docstrings THEN the system SHALL compile and execute exactly as before
2. WHEN mixing functions with and without docstrings THEN the system SHALL handle both cases correctly
3. WHEN upgrading from a version without docstring support THEN existing compiled code SHALL remain compatible
4. WHEN the parser encounters malformed docstring syntax THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages
5. IF docstring parsing fails THEN the system SHALL fall back to treating the string as part of the function body

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a MiniScheme compiler developer, I want proper error handling for docstring-related syntax errors, so that users receive helpful feedback when they make mistakes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a docstring is not a valid string literal THEN the system SHALL report a syntax error
2. WHEN docstring syntax is malformed THEN the system SHALL provide error messages indicating the expected format
3. WHEN a function has only a docstring but no body THEN the system SHALL report an error about missing function body
4. WHEN docstring parsing encounters unexpected tokens THEN the system SHALL report what was expected
5. IF the docstring contains invalid escape sequences THEN the system SHALL report string parsing errors with location information
