# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements proper handling of "unspecified values" in the MiniScheme interpreter. In Scheme, certain expressions like `(define ...)`, `(set! ...)`, and I/O procedures like `(display ...)` are executed primarily for their side effects rather than to produce meaningful return values. These expressions return an "unspecified value" that should not be printed by the REPL, distinguishing them from actual data values like `'()` (empty list) which should be displayed. This implementation will add a special `Unspecified` value type and modify the REPL behavior to handle it correctly according to Scheme standards.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a Scheme programmer, I want expressions executed for side effects (like `define`, `set!`, `display`) to return unspecified values that don't clutter the REPL output, so that I can distinguish between meaningful data values and side-effect-only operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the interpreter evaluates a `define` expression THEN it SHALL create the binding and return an unspecified value
2. WHEN the interpreter evaluates a `set!` expression THEN it SHALL update the binding and return an unspecified value  
3. WHEN the interpreter evaluates a `display` expression THEN it SHALL output the value and return an unspecified value
4. WHEN the interpreter evaluates a `newline` expression THEN it SHALL output a newline and return an unspecified value
5. WHEN the interpreter evaluates an `if` expression without an else clause and the condition is false THEN it SHALL return an unspecified value
6. WHEN the interpreter evaluates an `import` expression THEN it SHALL load the module and return an unspecified value

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a Scheme programmer, I want the REPL to distinguish between unspecified values and actual data values, so that only meaningful results are displayed and my REPL session remains clean and readable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the REPL receives an unspecified value as the result of evaluation THEN it SHALL not print anything and only show a prompt for the next input
2. WHEN the REPL receives a meaningful data value (including `'()`) THEN it SHALL print the value in proper Scheme format
3. WHEN the REPL receives `'()` (empty list) THEN it SHALL print `()` as it is a legitimate data value
4. WHEN the REPL receives other data types (numbers, strings, symbols, lists) THEN it SHALL print them normally
5. WHEN the REPL processes multiple expressions where some return unspecified values THEN it SHALL only print the results of expressions that return specified values

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a compiler implementer, I want a distinct `Unspecified` value type in the object system, so that the runtime can properly represent and handle unspecified values without confusing them with other data types.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the object system is extended THEN it SHALL include an `Unspecified` variant that carries no data
2. WHEN comparing unspecified values THEN they SHALL be equal to each other but not equal to any other value type
3. WHEN converting an unspecified value to string representation THEN it SHALL use a format like `#<unspecified>` for debugging purposes
4. WHEN the garbage collector encounters unspecified values THEN it SHALL handle them correctly as any other object type
5. WHEN serializing or debugging unspecified values THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate representation

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a Scheme programmer, I want I/O procedures to behave correctly with unspecified values, so that output operations work as expected while maintaining proper return value semantics.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN `display` is called with any value THEN it SHALL output the value to stdout and return an unspecified value
2. WHEN `write` is called with any value THEN it SHALL output the value in readable format and return an unspecified value
3. WHEN `newline` is called THEN it SHALL output a newline character and return an unspecified value
4. WHEN multiple I/O operations are chained THEN each SHALL perform its side effect and return unspecified values
5. WHEN I/O procedures are used in expressions that expect return values THEN the unspecified values SHALL be handled according to context rules

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a Scheme programmer, I want proper error handling when unspecified values are used inappropriately, so that I can understand when I'm misusing side-effect operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an unspecified value is used in arithmetic operations THEN the system SHALL report a type error
2. WHEN an unspecified value is used as a function THEN the system SHALL report that it's not callable
3. WHEN an unspecified value is used in list operations like `car` or `cdr` THEN the system SHALL report appropriate type errors
4. WHEN debugging or tracing execution THEN unspecified values SHALL be clearly identified in debug output
5. WHEN error messages reference unspecified values THEN they SHALL use clear terminology like "unspecified value" rather than internal representations

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a compiler implementer, I want the bytecode system to efficiently handle unspecified values, so that side-effect operations compile and execute correctly without performance overhead.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN compiling expressions that return unspecified values THEN the compiler SHALL generate appropriate bytecode to create unspecified value objects
2. WHEN the VM executes bytecode for side-effect operations THEN it SHALL perform the side effect and push an unspecified value onto the stack
3. WHEN the VM encounters unspecified values in operations THEN it SHALL handle them according to the operation's semantics
4. WHEN optimizing bytecode THEN the compiler MAY optimize unspecified value creation but SHALL maintain correct semantics
5. WHEN the VM returns unspecified values to the REPL THEN it SHALL provide the necessary information for proper display handling

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a Scheme programmer, I want conditional expressions without else clauses to return unspecified values when the condition is false, so that the behavior matches standard Scheme semantics.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN evaluating `(if #f expr)` (no else clause) THEN the system SHALL return an unspecified value
2. WHEN evaluating `(if #t expr)` (no else clause) THEN the system SHALL return the result of evaluating `expr`
3. WHEN evaluating `(if condition then-expr else-expr)` THEN the system SHALL return the result of the appropriate branch, never an unspecified value
4. WHEN nested if expressions without else clauses evaluate to false THEN each level SHALL return an unspecified value appropriately
5. WHEN if expressions are used in contexts expecting values THEN unspecified results SHALL be handled according to context rules
