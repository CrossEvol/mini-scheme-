# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements support for Scheme's multiple values mechanism through the `values` and `call-with-values` procedures. The `values` procedure allows functions to return multiple values, while `call-with-values` provides a way to capture and use these multiple values. This implementation will extend the existing MiniScheme bytecode compiler and virtual machine to handle multiple return values efficiently using a stack-based approach with specialized bytecode instructions.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a Scheme programmer, I want to use the `values` procedure to return multiple values from a function, so that I can write more expressive and efficient code that doesn't require packaging multiple results into data structures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a function calls `(values v1 v2 ... vn)` THEN the system SHALL return all n values as separate return values
2. WHEN `values` is called with zero arguments `(values)` THEN the system SHALL return zero values
3. WHEN `values` is called with one argument `(values v)` THEN the system SHALL return that single value (equivalent to returning v directly)
4. WHEN `values` is called with multiple arguments THEN the system SHALL preserve the order and type of all arguments as return values

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a Scheme programmer, I want to use `call-with-values` to capture and process multiple values returned by a producer function, so that I can work with multiple return values in a structured way.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN `call-with-values` is called with a producer and consumer function THEN the system SHALL call the producer with no arguments
2. WHEN the producer returns multiple values THEN the system SHALL pass all returned values as arguments to the consumer function
3. WHEN the producer returns a single value THEN the system SHALL pass that value as a single argument to the consumer
4. WHEN the producer returns zero values THEN the system SHALL call the consumer with no arguments
5. WHEN the consumer function executes THEN the system SHALL return the consumer's return value as the result of `call-with-values`

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a compiler implementer, I want the bytecode virtual machine to efficiently handle multiple values using stack-based operations without composite types, so that the implementation is performant and follows proper Scheme semantics.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN compiling `values` expressions THEN the compiler SHALL generate `OP_RETURN_VALUES` instructions with the count of values
2. WHEN compiling `call-with-values` expressions THEN the compiler SHALL generate `OP_CALL_WITH_VALUES` instructions
3. WHEN the VM executes `OP_RETURN_VALUES` THEN it SHALL leave the specified number of individual values on the stack and record the count
4. WHEN the VM executes `OP_CALL_WITH_VALUES` THEN it SHALL coordinate the producer and consumer function calls correctly
5. WHEN multiple values are returned THEN the VM SHALL NOT package them into a `MultipleValues` type but keep them as separate stack values
6. WHEN multiple values need to be tracked THEN the VM SHALL use metadata (like return value count) rather than composite data structures

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a Scheme programmer, I want multiple values to integrate correctly with existing language constructs according to Scheme semantics, so that the behavior matches standard Scheme implementations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN exactly one value is returned in a single-value context THEN the system SHALL use that value normally
2. WHEN multiple values (more than one) are returned in a single-value context THEN the system SHALL report an error "returned N values to single value return context"
3. WHEN a function that doesn't explicitly return multiple values is used as a producer THEN the system SHALL treat its single return value as a single value
4. WHEN zero values are returned in a single-value context THEN the system SHALL report an error about zero values in single value context
5. WHEN debugging or tracing execution THEN the system SHALL properly display multiple values in a readable format

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer working with the MiniScheme implementation, I want comprehensive error handling for multiple values operations, so that I can debug issues and ensure robust execution.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN `call-with-values` is called with incorrect argument types THEN the system SHALL report a clear error message
2. WHEN the producer function in `call-with-values` expects arguments THEN the system SHALL report an error
3. WHEN the consumer function signature doesn't match the number of values produced THEN the system SHALL report an arity mismatch error
4. WHEN stack overflow occurs due to multiple values operations THEN the system SHALL handle it gracefully with appropriate error reporting
5. WHEN invalid bytecode instructions are encountered THEN the system SHALL provide clear diagnostic information
