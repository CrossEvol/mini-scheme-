# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for implementing a bytecode compiler and runtime system for the MiniScheme language. The system will transform the existing AST representation into bytecode instructions and provide a virtual machine to execute the bytecode. This includes defining object types for Scheme data types, implementing bytecode generation, and creating an interpreter to execute the bytecode.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a MiniScheme developer, I want a runtime object system that represents all Scheme data types, so that the bytecode interpreter can manipulate values during execution.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system encounters a number literal THEN it SHALL create a Number object that stores the numeric value
2. WHEN the system encounters a string literal THEN it SHALL create a String object that stores the string content
3. WHEN the system encounters a character literal THEN it SHALL create a Character object that stores the character value
4. WHEN the system encounters a boolean literal THEN it SHALL create a Boolean object that stores the boolean value
5. WHEN the system encounters a list THEN it SHALL create a List object that stores references to other objects
6. WHEN the system encounters a vector THEN it SHALL create a Vector object that stores references to other objects
7. WHEN the system encounters a hashtable THEN it SHALL create a Hashtable object with key-value mappings
8. WHEN the system encounters a function THEN it SHALL create a Function object that stores bytecode and parameter information
9. WHEN the system encounters a closure THEN it SHALL create a Closure object that captures upvalues from its environment
10. WHEN the system encounters an upvalue THEN it SHALL create an Upvalue object that manages variable capture and lifetime
11. WHEN the system encounters null THEN it SHALL create a Null object representing the empty value

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a MiniScheme compiler, I want to generate bytecode instructions from AST nodes, so that the program can be executed efficiently by a virtual machine.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN compiling a literal expression THEN the compiler SHALL generate a LOAD_CONST instruction with the literal value
2. WHEN compiling a variable reference THEN the compiler SHALL generate appropriate LOAD_VAR, LOAD_LOCAL, or LOAD_UPVALUE instruction
3. WHEN compiling a function call THEN the compiler SHALL generate CALL instruction with argument count
4. WHEN compiling a define expression THEN the compiler SHALL generate STORE_VAR instruction to bind the value
5. WHEN compiling a lambda expression THEN the compiler SHALL generate CLOSURE instruction with upvalue capture information
6. WHEN compiling an if expression THEN the compiler SHALL generate conditional jump instructions
7. WHEN compiling a let expression THEN the compiler SHALL generate instructions for local variable binding and scope management
8. WHEN compiling arithmetic operations THEN the compiler SHALL generate appropriate operation instructions
9. WHEN a local variable is captured by a closure THEN the compiler SHALL mark it as captured and generate CLOSE_UPVALUE instructions
10. WHEN exiting a scope with captured variables THEN the compiler SHALL generate CLOSE_UPVALUE instructions before POP instructions

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a MiniScheme runtime, I want a virtual machine that can execute bytecode instructions, so that MiniScheme programs can run correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN executing a LOAD_CONST instruction THEN the VM SHALL push the constant value onto the stack
2. WHEN executing a LOAD_VAR instruction THEN the VM SHALL look up the global variable and push its value onto the stack
3. WHEN executing a LOAD_LOCAL instruction THEN the VM SHALL load the local variable from the current stack frame
4. WHEN executing a LOAD_UPVALUE instruction THEN the VM SHALL load the captured variable through the upvalue mechanism
5. WHEN executing a STORE_VAR instruction THEN the VM SHALL pop a value from the stack and bind it to the global variable
6. WHEN executing a SET_LOCAL instruction THEN the VM SHALL store a value to a local variable in the current stack frame
7. WHEN executing a SET_UPVALUE instruction THEN the VM SHALL store a value through the upvalue mechanism
8. WHEN executing a CALL instruction THEN the VM SHALL invoke the closure with the specified number of arguments
9. WHEN executing a CLOSURE instruction THEN the VM SHALL create a closure object and capture the specified upvalues
10. WHEN executing a CLOSE_UPVALUE instruction THEN the VM SHALL close upvalues that are leaving scope
11. WHEN executing conditional jump instructions THEN the VM SHALL branch based on the condition result
12. WHEN executing arithmetic instructions THEN the VM SHALL perform the operation on stack values
13. WHEN the program completes THEN the VM SHALL return the final result

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a MiniScheme user, I want proper error handling during bytecode execution, so that I can understand what went wrong when my program fails.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a runtime error occurs THEN the VM SHALL provide a meaningful error message
2. WHEN accessing an undefined variable THEN the VM SHALL throw an "undefined variable" error
3. WHEN calling a non-function value THEN the VM SHALL throw a "not a function" error
4. WHEN performing invalid operations THEN the VM SHALL throw appropriate type errors
5. WHEN stack overflow occurs THEN the VM SHALL throw a "stack overflow" error
6. WHEN the program encounters invalid bytecode THEN the VM SHALL throw an "invalid instruction" error

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a MiniScheme developer, I want built-in functions to be available during execution, so that I can use standard Scheme operations like car, cdr, cons, etc.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN calling car on a list THEN the VM SHALL return the first element
2. WHEN calling cdr on a list THEN the VM SHALL return the rest of the list
3. WHEN calling cons with two arguments THEN the VM SHALL create a new list with the first argument as head
4. WHEN calling arithmetic operations THEN the VM SHALL perform the correct mathematical computation
5. WHEN calling predicate functions THEN the VM SHALL return the appropriate boolean result
6. WHEN calling type conversion functions THEN the VM SHALL convert between compatible types
7. WHEN calling display function THEN the VM SHALL output the value to stdout

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a MiniScheme compiler, I want to handle special forms correctly during bytecode generation, so that control flow and binding constructs work as expected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN compiling a cond expression THEN the compiler SHALL generate a series of conditional jumps
2. WHEN compiling a let expression THEN the compiler SHALL generate instructions for local scope creation
3. WHEN compiling a let* expression THEN the compiler SHALL generate sequential binding instructions
4. WHEN compiling a let-loop expression THEN the compiler SHALL generate loop setup and jump instructions
5. WHEN compiling a set! expression THEN the compiler SHALL generate variable mutation instructions
6. WHEN compiling a begin expression THEN the compiler SHALL generate instructions for sequential execution
7. WHEN compiling quoted expressions THEN the compiler SHALL generate literal data construction instructions

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a MiniScheme developer, I want proper closure support with lexical scoping, so that inner functions can access variables from their enclosing scope even after the outer function returns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a lambda expression references a variable from an outer scope THEN the compiler SHALL identify it as an upvalue
2. WHEN creating a closure THEN the VM SHALL capture all necessary upvalues from the current environment
3. WHEN an upvalue is still on the stack THEN it SHALL remain "open" and point directly to the stack location
4. WHEN a captured variable goes out of scope THEN the VM SHALL "close" the upvalue by copying the value to the heap
5. WHEN accessing a closed upvalue THEN the VM SHALL read from the heap-allocated copy
6. WHEN multiple closures capture the same variable THEN they SHALL share the same upvalue object
7. WHEN a closure is called THEN it SHALL have access to all its captured upvalues regardless of the current call stack
8. WHEN nested closures exist THEN inner closures SHALL be able to capture upvalues from outer closures
